OC for lenovo ideapad P400    10.15 works

!!!!Currently the battery and brightness not work

Just changed wifi and hasn't modified the OC to load it.
Changed wifi card to BCM94352HMB. Followed the guidance from these two website:

Firstly delete the white list and load the new wifi card. Read the Device ID and SUBSYS ID.
Then modifie the white list to include the new wifi card to make the system stable.
Fpt only run in dos mode. (Remember to open lagency support to boot to Dos)
